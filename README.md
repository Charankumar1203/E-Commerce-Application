# E-Commerce-Application
#### A simple user-interactive e-commerce application written in C++ that can be accessed via the command line.
#### Users can create account, add items to the cart, and the app administrator can manage the user accounts and the items in the inventory.

To use the application, just type 'make' and press enter in the terminal by changing your working directory to 'EComApp' after cloning the repo to your machine. This will compile all the files and generates you an executable 'MyEComApp' which can be run directly from the terminal (by typing ./MyEComApp in the terminal).
